# Better Rods

Were you under the impression that buying a fishing rod makes fishing easier? Well, that's actually wrong! The only advantage they have is that they can use bait, and eventually tackles. Every other tool upgrade in the game does make it better at its job, so why not fishing rods? This mod aims to add that. _Better fishing rods_ makes the higher tier fishing rods actually better at the fishing minigame.
# Features

* Makes higher tier fishing rods (Fiberglass, Iridium) better at the fishing minigame:
  * **Faster nibble time**, giving you faster bites.
  * **Faster fishing bar**, making control slightly harder to stabilise, but helps catching up with faster fish
  * **Faster catching**, the catch bar (on the right of the fishing minigame) increases faster when your bar is on a fish
  * **Slower loss**, the catch bar (on the right of the fishing minigame) decreases slower when your bar is not on the fish
* Highly configurable:
  * Every setting can be globally turned on/off
    *  Don't want faster fishing bar? Simply turn it off!
  * Every setting above is configurable per fishing rod.
  * Recommendatons:
    * Don't increase bar speed to high/low, as this makes it harder to control.
* Balanced for vanilla (by default):
  * Nibble times are 5% faster for fiberglass rod, and 10% faster for iridium rod.
  * Bamboo pole and training rod are slightly nerfed (0.9x effective)
  * Fiberglass is the same as a vanilla rod (1x effective)
  * Iridium rod is slightly better (1.1x effective)
