# Multiplayer Exp sharing

Ever played a multiplayer game where you'd have to fight over who gets to harvest the crops, chop the trees and mine the diamond node? Well that is no more! With this mod, every exp point you gain is shared with nearby players so that everyone levels about equally.

This mod lets you redistribute the exp you get with nearby players, players on the same map, or globally. With default settings, the person doing the action gaining exp still gets the majority, however this can be configured to share exp equally. Every skill can also be toggled on and off to work with exp share.

# Important notes

* Every player in the server should have this mod, if they don't the exp sharing will not work properly and you will lose exp overall.
* Currently this mod only works with vanilla skills, excluding the unimplemented luck skill
* All settings in the `config.json` (or when you use the [GenericModConfigMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) mod) only apply to the exp you share. For example, if you disable the farming skill that means you will not share your experience gained from farming, but you can still receive farming exp from other players. For the best experience, I would recommend everyone use the same settings.

# Compatibility

This mod relies on the base game's exp and levelling system. Any mod that changes how that work will most likely break this mod, or cause unintended behaviour.
