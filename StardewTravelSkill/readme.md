# Stardew Travelling Skill

Travel skill for Stardew Valley, available on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16820/). The skill is leveled by walking around and requires about 300.000 steps to fully max.


# Features

- Adds new skill to the game using SpaceCore, meaning it is compatible with Cooking skill and Luck skill mods.
    - Skill levels up based on steps taken by player
    - Every level in the skill gives a configurable amount of movespeed
- Professions:
  - **Movespeed** - +5% movespeed
    - **Champion Runner** - Sprint after walking for a few steps
    - **Marathon Runner** - Regain stamina passively
  - **Warp Enjoyer** - Makes warp totems cheaper to craft
    - **Obelisk Builde** - Makes obelisks 50% cheaper to build (gold cost only)
    - **Totem reuser** - 50% chance to keep totem after use
