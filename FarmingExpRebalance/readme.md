# Farming Exp rebalance

In progress, farming exp rebalance serves to readjust the way farming exp is gained. Instead of purely gaining it from harvesting crops (and animal stuff), other farming skill related activities will increase it as well. These include hoeing and watering.

The vast majority of farming skill is gained from harvesting crops, which in my opinion is quite unsatisfying as the majority of the time you're watering crops and tilling ground for new crops. Therefore, this mod serves to add that feature and shift some exp gained from harvesting towards watering and hoeing. It also serves to indirectly nerf sprinklers, as in the base game there is almost no reason for you to ever manually water your crops when you unlock them.
