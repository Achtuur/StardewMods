# Automate Speedup Statue

Do you want to upgrade your machines? Do you feel like your machines are just a tad bit too slow? Do you have enough prismatic shards laying around?
Well then, this is the mod for you! This mod introduces the _Prismatic Statue_, this statue lets you speedup all adjacent machines in the same group.

**Requires [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063), [JSON Assets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720), and [Mail Framework Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1536)**

## Features

* Adds in the _Prismatic Statue_.
  * Speeds up machines in the same machine group.
  * Recipe purchasable from Robin, after earning 6 friendship hearts with Robin, the Wizard and completing the community center.
  * Multiple statues stack, with diminishing returns and up to a certain maximum.
  * Works on (almost) all machines in vanilla Stardew Valley.
    * Does **not** work on Casks in the current version (1.0.0), as they are coded differently.

* Overlay showing the machines currently sped up.
  * Toggle overlay with `L` (can be changed in config).
  * Legend:
    * Rainbow: _Prismatic Statues_.
    * Magenta: Machines that are sped up & processing something.
    * Purple: Machines that are sped up, but not processing anything currently.
    * White: Objects in the same group as the statue, but not affected.
